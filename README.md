# HeadphoneData

Example of using matplotlib and pandas for a real world application. Data has been pulled from the web-scraped results from [AutoEq](https://github.com/jaakkopasanen/AutoEq). The results folder is also generated from [AutoEq](https://github.com/jaakkopasanen/AutoEq)'s generation tool. I wanted to make this project to help me better understand how the eq process works for my headphones and how headphone measurements are mapped.
